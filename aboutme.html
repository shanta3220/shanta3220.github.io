									<h1>Hi There!</h1>	</header>
									<p class = "align-center">This is Shanta, I'm a Game Programmer and Developer from Bangladesh, specializing in Game Programming. I've been developing games with Unity3D for 2 years and learning new things almost everyday, and often become crazier than I already am thanks to this profession. I really like to play games and research similar related games that I'm developing for obvious reasons.
											I'm a graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm also interested in researching Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality field and hoping to do PhD on them [ambitious, ain't i?].</br></br>
											I've participated in few of the of project showcasing competitions in my Undergraduate years. The below picture shows few those moments [I miss them already]:
